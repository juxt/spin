_Far more web_ for _much less code_.

Spin is a small, https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/2.0/SPEC-2.md[Ring
2.0]-compatible, Clojure library that helps you write HTTP endpoints that
actually conform to HTTP.

== Introduction

Since the earliest web servers, dynamic behaviour in web servers has been built
on the https://www.w3.org/CGI/[CGI: Common Gateway Interface]. CGI itself has
been consigned to history but the model of web development that it inspired is
still by far the dominant model used by developers of dynamic websites and web
APIs.

In CGI, a web-server captures information about a web request (such as the
request method, path, remote address, query-string, etc.) and calls a sends it
to an external program, script, plugin or in-process function, that generates
the response on behalf of the web server.

As web-servers have evolved, virtually every web library and framework has
inherited this primeval design: from Java's 'servlets' and Ruby's
https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/09/rack-middleware/[Rack] and PHP to Node.js
Express, Erlang's https://www.phoenixframework.org/[Phoenix], Clojure's
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] and hundreds more.

=== Problem Statement

The problem at the heart of CGI, and everything based on it, is that it is an
interface based on a web _request_ rather than a web _resource_. It was designed
to attach basic scripts to web servers, not to build the web itself.

The web is built on the HTTP protocol, which governs how browsers, web-servers,
proxies and other participants communicate. What does HTTP provide? It's right
there in just the second paragraph:

[quote,RFC 7231 - Section 1]
____
HTTP provides a uniform interface for interacting with a _resource_
____

The problem with CGI-based web libraries is that CGI is too low-level. It asks
too much of developers who have to recreate this 'resource' abstraction in every
handler they write. Of course this results in HTTP services that are half-baked,
half-implemented and non-comformant with HTTP. This makes the web poorer, more
brittle, *less inter-operable*, *less flexible*, *more expensive to create and
maintain*.

=== Proposed Solution

This project defines a new _resource-oriented_ interface to replace CGI.

It also provides an adapter that converts the CGI-based request-oriented
interface of Java/Clojure web servers to this new resource-oriented interface.

You provide the resource (in the form of data and functions). In exchange, you
get a Ring 2.0 handler that fully conforms with HTTP.

Spin's goal is to assist developers in implementing RFCs 7231-7235, and possibly
other RFCs, as faithfully as possible.

Spin is a Clojure project because that language provides a very fast design
iteration cycle. But it's hoped that once Spin's design stabilises it can be
copied by others, just as CGI was.

=== Status

Spin is still under active development and is ALPHA status, meaning that the API
should be considered unstable and likely to change.

It is planned that Spin will be agnostic as to whether you are using Ring's sync
(1-arity) of async (3-arity) forms and will support both.

=== Naming

The name 'spin' is a deliberate pun on the word 'web'.

== Technical Guide

Spin is based on Clojure maps, with namespaced keywords. Functions take maps
and, usually, return other maps.

You create a Ring handler with `juxt.spin.alpha/handler` that takes a single
argument, the *resource*.

.Hello World!
====
For example, to return the message "Hello World!" from a GET request:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[juxt.spin.alpha :as spin])

(def hello-resource
  {::spin/representation
    {::spin/content "Hello World!\n"}})

(def hello
  (spin/handler hello-resource))

(hello {:ring.request/method :get})
=>
{:ring.response/status 200
 :ring.response/headers
  {"content-length" "13"
   "date" "Thu, 26 Nov 2020 16:53:14 GMT"}
 :ring.response/body "Hello World!\n"}
----
====

[[resource-map]]
=== Resources

The *resource* is a Clojure map.

It can contain any entries you like, to describe what you want.

But the ones with keywords in the `juxt.spin.alpha` namespace are reserved. They
are the declarations that Spin uses to process a request properly.

Each resource entry is described below.

[[validate-request]]
==== `validate-request!`

A function that takes a context argument and returns it, or (optionally) a
modified version of it, if the request is valid.

The resource can be found in the `:resource` entry of the context.

If the request is malformed or invalid in some way, the function MUST respond
directly using the function in the `:respond!` entry of the context.

When responding, the function SHOULD use the value in the `:response` entry of
the context (although it is free to modify it as necessary).

.Responding with a 400 (Bad Request)
====

Say you have a resource that requires a query parameter to be present. Requests
without this query parameter are considered invalid and should result in a 400
response.

[source,clojure]
----
{::spin/representation {}
 ::spin/validate-request!
 (fn [{::spin/keys [request respond! response] :as ctx}]
   (if (:ring.request/query request)
     ctx
     ;; No query string, bad request!
     (respond!
      (assoc
       response
       :ring.response/status 400
       :ring.response/body "Bad request!"))))}
----
====

The `validate-request!` is also the place to authenticate the request and ensure
it is authorized to interact with the resource.

.Authorizing a request
[source,clojure]
====

In this example, we use the `validate-request!` function in conjunction with
some custom data in our resource to implement restrictions to a resource.

First, we'll need to authenticate the request. We'll assign each request a
single role.

WARNING: We'll use an extremely silly authentication scheme (called `Terrible`)
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS EXPLANATION ONLY. Don't copy this!

Then we'll check the role provides the entitlement to access the resource using
the method in the requested. We could use any arbitary authorization logic here
instead.

The `validate-request!` function first determines the role by authenticating the
request. Normally, you wouldn't automatically trust the user agent like this,
instead, you'd add some way of verifying the trust, e.g. JWT signatures, a
database lookup.

[source,clojure]
----
{:roles {:superuser #{:get :head :put}
         :manager #{:get :head}} <1>
 ::spin/representation {::spin/content "Secret stuff!"}
 ::spin/validate-request!
 (fn [{::spin/keys [request respond! response] :as ctx}]
   (when-let [role <2>
               (case (get-in request
                             [:ring.request/headers "authorization"])

                 "Terrible let-me-in;role=superuser"
                 :superuser

                 "Terrible let-me-in;role=manager"
                 :manager

                 (respond! <3>
                  (-> response
                      (assoc :ring.response/status 401)
                      (assoc-in
                       [:ring.response/headers "www-authenticate"]
                       "Terrible"))))]

     (if (get-in resource
           [:roles role (:ring.request/method request)]) <4>
       (assoc ctx :role role) <5>
       (respond! (assoc response :ring.response/status 403)) <6>
       )))}
----
<1> some custom data in the resource map we'll use later
<2> authenticate the request
<3> respond with a 401 if tell the user-agent to send credentials
<4> is the method allowed for this role?
<5> yes? then the request can proceed, return the ctx (adding the role)
<6> no? then the request is forbidden, return a 403
====

[[select-representation]]
==== `select-representation!`

A function that takes a context argument and returns a map corresponding to the
selected representation's metadata.

The representation should be chosen based on the request (the `:request` entry
of the context) and the response (the `:response` entry of the context). Usually
this means looking up the `:ring.response/status` of the response, since the
desirable content type often depends on the status of the response. For
instance, the representation of an error might only be available in English,
regardless of the language preferences of the user agent.

Proactive content negotiation may be employed to determine the representation.

// TODO: Add an example of using pick to select and return a single
// representation map.

If there are no representations, regardless of their acceptability, you MUST
respond with a 404 response, calling the `:respond!` function provided in the
context argument.

// TODO: Add an example of a 404

Otherwise, if none of the representations are acceptable, you MAY respond with a
406 response, in which you SHOULD add a `Vary` header. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-7.1.4[Section 7.1.4 of RFC
7231] for how to construct the `Vary` header.

// TODO: Add an example of a 406, with Vary header

Alternatively, you may wish to return one anyway, since "sending a response that
doesn't conform to the user agent's preferences" might be "better than sending a
406" (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-3.4.1[Section 3.4.1 of RFC 7231]).

// TODO: Add an example of returning a single representation

Finally, if you wish to use
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-3.4.2[Reactive Negotiation],
respond with a 300 response with the response payload of your choosing. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-3.4.2[Section 3.4.2 of RFC
7231] for further details.

// TODO: Add an example of Reactive Negotiation

==== `methods`

A map that maps method keywords to their implementations.

If this entry is not provided, the resource will have default implementations of
GET, HEAD and OPTIONS.

.Declaring methods
====
To indicate the methods on a resource, add a `::spin/methods` entry.

[source,clojure]
----
{::spin/methods
  {:post
    (fn [ctx]
      ;; Insert new record into database
      (spin/resource-created! ctx "/new-resource"))}}
----
====

The implementations are as follows.

===== `get`

A function that takes the context as an argument.

The function is called on a POST request.

The `get` method should respond with a Ring response containing the selected
representation.

===== `post`

A function that takes the context as an argument.

The function is called on a POST request. It is responsible for any data
processing associated with a POST. If a new resource is created, it should
respond with a 201 status and a `Location` header containing the URL of the new
resource. A convenience function is available
(`juxt.spin.alpha/resource-created!`) which does this.

To respond, it should call the `respond!` function provided in the context
argument with the (Ring 2.0) response as an argument.

See link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-4.3.3[Section 4.3.3 of
RFC 7231] for further details.

===== `put`

A function that takes the context as an argument.

The function is called on a PUT request.

Generally speaking, the `put` function is responsible for replacing the state
of the target resource with the representation enclosed in the request message
payload.

Like the `post` method, a PUT should respond with a 201 status is the target
resource doesn't have a representation until the PUT successfully creates
one. Otherwise, it should respond with a 200 (or 204) to indicate successful
modification of an existing representation.

To respond, it should call the `respond!` function provided in the context
argument with the (Ring 2.0) response as an argument.

See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-4.3.4[Section 4.3.4 of RFC
7231] for further details.

===== `delete`

A function that takes the context as an argument.

The function is called on a DELETE request.

To respond, it should call the `respond!` function provided in the context
argument with the (Ring 2.0) response as an argument.

See
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-4.3.5[Section 4.3.5 of RFC
7231] for further details.

=== Representations

The <<select-representation,`select-representation!`>> function should return
representation metadata. This is a Clojure map which can contain any data, but
entries with keywords in the `juxt.spin.alpha` are meaningful to Spin.

==== `respond!`

A representation can declare a single-arity function which will generate the
actual Ring response.

If this is not provided, then Spin will do its best to return a representation
defined by the representation metadata in the map.

==== `content`

The representation's content, the body of a GET response, as a string.

==== `content-type`

The media-type of the representation.

==== `content-encoding`

How the representation's content is encoded.

==== `content-language`

How natural language (or languages) of the representation.

// TODO: How are multiple languages to be specified? See pick

==== `content-length`

The length, in bytes, of the representation's content.

==== `content-range`

The partial byte-range of the representation.

==== `last-modified`

The instant (a `java.util.Date`) that the representation was last modified.

==== `entity-tag`

The entity tag. Must be a string delimited with double-quotes.

====
[source,clojure]
----
{::spin/entity-tag "\"a6es7q53s\""}
----
====

=== Request context

On each request, a *request context* is created. This is a map with the
following entries:

==== `request`

A map describing a Ring request, see
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/2.0/SPEC-2.md

==== `respond!`

A callback function that is used to return a Ring response, which is map. See
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/2.0/SPEC-2.md for full details.

==== `raise!`

A callback function that is used to raise any errors. See
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/2.0/SPEC-2.md for full details.

==== `resource`

The target resource, as a map. See <<resource-map>>.

=== Keyword naming

Keywords are all in the `juxt.spin.alpha` namespace, unless otherwise stated.

Keywords that end in a `!` indicate functions that can directly produce a Ring
response via the `respond!` callback provided in the first parameter of the
function. Sending a response back to the user agent is certainly a side-effect,
so the Clojure convention is adopted of marking functions that potentially cause
side-effects.

[appendix]
== Comparison to _yada_

JUXT publish another library, https://github.com/juxt/yada[_yada_], which shares
similar goals to this project. Spin in a much younger project, and is hoped to
be an official successor to _yada_. They do have simiarities but Spin is
smaller, with fewer dependencies, and a significantly different design. In
comparison, Spin can be considered less opinionated and more modular than
_yada_. But at the present time, it doesn't quite have as much funcionality
built-in. This may change over time, of course.

=== Async

Both Spin and _yada_ fully support fulfilling each request in an asynchronous
manner, to avoid blocking the request thread. In the case of _yada_,
https://github.com/aleph-io/manifold[Manifold] is used to provide async chaining
of operations.

Spin is built on the asynchronous standard defined in Ring 1.6 which was not yet
established when _yada_ was designed. This provides independence from the
underlying server and full compatibility with existing Ring middleware. In
contrast, _yada_'s use of Manifold fixes it to
https://github.com/aleph-io/aleph/[aleph], a Clojure wrapper on
https://netty.io/[Netty].

However, one sizeable benefit of _yada_'s dependence on Aleph does mean it is
easy access to create asynchronous response streams, for instance, to create
streams of server-sent events. Work is underway on a comparable set of
functionality for Spin based on https://vertx.io/[Vert.x], via our
https://github.com/juxt/vext[Vext] project, although this is some way from
feature parity.

In _yada_, blocking operations can be wrapped in asynchronous chains using
Manifold's `chain` function. In Spin, the `respond!` function can be passed
around between threads and invoked in a different thread from the request
thread, which can prevent blocking the request thread during the request
processing. For non-blocking steaming of response payloads (which might be
standardised in a future Ring 2.1), there is some work underway within Vext on
adopting the Java interfaces defined by
http://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams].

=== Resource map validation

_yada_ uses https://github.com/plumatic/schema[Primatic Schema] for validation
of its resource maps. Spin uses Clojure's now built-in
https://clojure.org/guides/spec[spec].

=== Responses

Sometimes you need to take over request processing from a library and send your
own response. In _yada_,
https://www.juxt.land/yada/manual/index.html#explicit-responses[explicit
responses] are provided. In Spin, care has been taken to allow for the calling
of the `respond!` callback. This allows implementations direct control of the
response.

=== OpenAPI

_yada_ supports the definition, via Prismatic Schema, of parameters to
facilitate the generation of OpenAPI (Swagger) descriptions.

Spin is agnostic to OpenAPI, and does not involve itself in the specification of
the types of parameters, request and response bodies. However, it is designed to
complement other projects that may seek to add these facilities to Spin. One
example is our https://github.com/juxt/apex[Apex] project, which aims to process
parameters according to their definitions in OpenAPI documents. The
https://www.openapis.org/blog/2020/06/18/openapi-3-1-0-rc0-its-here[reconvergence]
of OpenAPI 3.1.0 with JSON Schema hasn't escaped our notice, and we hope this
will allow direct use of JSON Schema, possibly supported by our
https://github.com/juxt/apex[jinx] library.

=== Content Negotiation

_yada_ supports a limited form of content negotiation, but is unable to use the
response status code in its determination of available variants. In Spin, the
status code is computed earlier, and can be used in content negotiation. This is
particularly relevant to OpenAPI, which allows for different status codes their
own variants.

Spin aligns directly with OpenAPI's declaration hierarchy: paths -> operations
-> statuses -> content-types. In comparison, in _yada_, the available
content-types for a given resource are usually declared statically, without
taking the response status code into consideration. Error representations, in
particular, are fixed, whereas in Spin a resource's variant representations are
computed dynamically, and can factor in the response's status code into the
decision.

For proactive (server-driven) content negotiation, Spin is designed to
interoperate with external algorithms, in particular, with
https://github.com/juxt/pick[pick].
