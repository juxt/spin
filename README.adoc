= Spin

Spin is an _unbundled_ web library, not a web _framework_.

What's the difference? By our definition, a library is a _set of supporting
utility functions_. In contrast, a framework is a system that calls into your
code, via functions (or callbacks). With a library, the _control_ of the program
is very much with the developer. With a framework, the overall control of the
program is taken away from the developer. This might or might not be a
worthwhile trade, depending on your needs.

== Status

Spin is still in development and is ALPHA status, meaning that the API
should be considered unstable and likely to change.

IMPORTANT: Currently, work on Spin has stopped temporarily and active development of the various utility functions is taking place in https://github.com/juxt/site.


== Naming

The name 'spin' is a deliberate pun on the word 'web'.
