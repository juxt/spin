=== Clojure setup

With Clojure's Ring library, we can handle a web request with a function. <<ring-handler>> illustrates a simple function that takes the web request and returns a web response.

(fn [req] <1>
  {:status 200 :body "OK"} <2>
)
----
<1> `req` is a Clojure map, containing details of the incoming web request
<2> This map is the value returned from the function. It contains details of the outgoing web response.

NOTE: Whether you want to use the 'classic' synchronous single-arity functions, or
asynchronous 3-arity functions, is up to you. This guide supports both.
