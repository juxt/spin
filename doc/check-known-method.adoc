****
Spin has a utility function called `unknown-method?` which can generate the necessary 501 response:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn unknown-method?
  "When the request method is unknown, return a 501 response."
  [request]
  (when-not
      (contains?
       #{:get :put :post :delete :options :trace :connect}
       (:request-method request))
      {:status 501}))
----

In our handler, we can call it like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(when-let [response (spin/unknown-method? request)]
  response)
